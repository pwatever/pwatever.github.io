<h1 id="american">AMERICAN FOOD</h1>
<p>steak is a tasty juicy piece of delicious meat. You can eat it with almost absoulutely anything. Its the most scrumptious piece of food I and Alison have ever had. Wow!! There are so many different types of steaks. For example: shoulder steak, tender loinsteak, rib eye steak, and pepper steak. Steak can be grilled, baked, and even BBQ. It makes it even more tasty. We eat steak almost every Saturday since it is our Sabbath and it is a custom to eat yummy meat food on this day because it makes you happy. What makes me happy is a nice piece of juicy steak ;) </p>

<p>Tomato soup served with grilled cheese is an american classic lunch. It tastes so delicious and yummy. It;s my favorite Magen David Yeshivah lunch that was ever served on this planet. I love it so much, it's great.</p>  </p>
